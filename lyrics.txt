_Born This Way_



My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Interlude]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

_My Agenda_



[Verse 1: Dorian Electra]
I've got this plan now
It's on my mind
And soon enough now
Everyone will fall in line
It's closing in now
You can't escape
On every corner waiting
Just to infiltrate

[Chorus: Dorian Electra]
My agenda
Might offend ya
Out here flexing in my
Rainbow suspenders
My agenda
Will infect ya
Out to getcha
It is my

[Verse 2: Dorian Electra]
Have you seen my pamphlets?
Have you read my blog?
Have you seen my army marching
Down to city hall?
You can always spot us
By the way we walk
As we’re plotting to take over
And destroy you all


[Chorus: Dorian Electra & Village People]
My agenda
Might offend ya
Out here flexing in my
Rainbow suspenders
My agenda
Will infect ya
Out to gеtcha
It is my

[Verse 3: Pussy Riot]
Москва — столица гейропы
Стали квирами все гомофобы
Духовные скрепы сменили на стропы
Мы радужным мобом по Красной топаем
Гей-пропаганда
Мы любим тебя от Чечни до Уганды
С тобой мы танцуем на Красной
У нас очень много секса, но он безопасный
Гей-пропаганда
We make love from Chеchnya to Uganda
Гей-пропаганда
We make love from Chechnya to Uganda

-- Pussy Riot translation

Moscow is the capital of Geyropa
All homophobes have become queer
Spiritual braces changed to slings
We are a rainbow mob on Red stomp
Gay propaganda
We love you from Chechnya to Uganda
With you we dance on Red
We have a lot of sex, but it's safe
Gay propaganda
We make love from Chechnya to Uganda
Gay propaganda
We make love from Chechnya to Uganda

Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz
If that's what you wanna do
If that's what you wanna do

[Verse 1]
If you want to make them scream
Look at me, it's simple
We'll make it easily
If you need that something, but don't know what it is
Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz
You've got to twist your body
Twirl it all around
Make it pop and sizzle
Now squish it on the ground
If you need that something, but don't know what it is
Shake, shake, shake, it up and make it fizz

[Chorus]
We can go crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
If that's what you wanna do

If that's what you wanna do
If that's what you wanna do

[Verse 2]
If you squish it in your hand
Make it pop, red and white
Tomato soup can
If you need that something
And that's really what you want
Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz
You've got to stir that mixture
Make it really thick
Let it drip all over
Now give the spoon a lick
If you need that something and that's really what you want
Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz

[Chorus]
We can go crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
If that's what you wanna do

Hey, we can jump up
We can get down low
Mix it all up

Whatever you want
There's nothing we can't do
'Cause we can go up
And that's what we gon' do
We can jump up, up, up
Make them say "Mmm yeah, wow, that's nice"
Smash it all up
Let it drip-drop low
Whatever you need
Just tell me and we'll go
'Cause we can stay here or we can go
We can go
We can go

_STUPID_


[Intro: Ashnikko]
Wet, wet, wet, wet (I'm shy)
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Oh my God

Chorus: Ashnikko]
Stupid boy think that I need him
I go cold like changin’ seasons
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him
Stupid boy think that I need him
[Verse 1: Ashnikko]
Pleasin', season, I'm spicy
Hot to touch, too much, too pricey
Heathen, I’m in your psyche
You don't know no one else like me, woah
Stupid boy think that I need him
Stupid boy think that I need him
I know you think about me in the shower
PornHub in your browser, fantasize about the pussy power
Think about me with your hand down your trousers
I'm sweet, then I'm sour, I'm big boss Bowser
I know you salivating over me, sir, nipples through the t-shirt
Told your mommy that you're bringin' home a keeper
Knees are getting weaker when he hear me through the speaker
Big wood, cut him off, cedar

[Chorus: Ashnikko & Yung Baby Tate]
Stupid boy think that I need him (Huh)
Stupid boy think that I need him (Huh)
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him
Stupid boy think that I need him (Stupid, stupid)
Stupid boy think that I need him (Stupid, stupid)
Stupid boy think that I need him
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him (Wet, wet)

[Verse 2: Yung Baby Tate]
Stupid-stupid, you dumb, you goofy-goofy (Ugh)
This pussy juicy-juicy, ooh yummy, wanna do me?
Oo nah, boy you could never
'Cause you not clever enough
And I got several dummies that wanna get on me
I don’t want you and I don’t want your homie
'Cause both of y’all are suckers, y'all some Dum-Dums
I could play you straight up out your bread, now you got crumb-crumbs
I don't really need a man, but sometimes I want one though
So I keep Peter Pans on me, I got young hundos
Young money, get it?

[Chorus: Ashnikko]
Stupid boy think that I need him (Leave me alone)
Stupid boy think that I need him
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him
Stupid boy think that I need him (Yeah)
Stupid boy think that I need him (Yeah)
Stupid boy think that I need him
I go red hot like a demon
I go ghost for no damn reason
Stupid boy think that I need him

[Verse 2: Yung Baby Tate]
Stupid-stupid, you dumb, you goofy-goofy (Ugh)
This pussy juicy-juicy, ooh yummy, wanna do me?
Oo nah, boy you could never
'Cause you not clever enough
And I got several dummies that wanna get on me
I don’t want you and I don’t want your homie
'Cause both of y’all are suckers, y'all some Dum-Dums
I could play you straight up out your bread, now you got crumb-crumbs
I don't really need a man, but sometimes I want one though
So I keep Peter Pans on me, I got young hundos

Nothing about you is attractive to me now
Blocking you, avoiding you actively right now (Blocked)
I don't need the dick, I need magic, I need money
Puppy wanna lick somethin’ sticky just like honey

[Outro: Yung Baby Tate & Ashnikko]
Stupid, stupid
Stupid, stupid
Wet, wet, wet

_Firework_




Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting thought the wind
Wanting to start again

Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under scream
But no one seems to hear a thing

Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down down down

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down down down

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down down down
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

_Saved_




Boy, you can have my heart to take
If you can find the way to make it break

I am vacant, void of love
Absent but it burns so hard
I need you in my heart


You are with me in my dreams 
This moment needs to go right on
Just give it to me all night long


You're savin' me
You're savin' me
Saved from myself I'm saved from myself
You're savin' me
You're savin' me
Boy!

_Montero_



[Verse 1]
I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right

[Pre-Chorus]
Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

[Chorus]
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buyin'
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy

[Pre-Chorus]
Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can
